# TSB from first day is unknown since it would require data from a day before.
# TSB from tomorrow (future) is known since the CTL, ATL, TSS of today is known.
# If i have TSS of 01.01.2020, i would need CTL and ATL of day before
#    CTL[nr] <- CTL[nr - 1] + (TSS[nr] - CTL[nr - 1]), but they are unknown
#    I can calculate CTL, ATL anyway, since i would take CTL and  ATL starting values. 
# --> CTL, ATL time series have to start one day prior to first TSS value. 
# --> TSB start on day of first TSS value and end one day after last TSS value
# ---> If TSS values are (uncompletely) available from 01.01.2020 to 10.01.2020. 
#      time series should go from 31.12.2019 to 11.01.2021. Missing values mean no
#      training so TSS of 0.

# TSB does not exist for first day or is 0. But is not NA for last day as for other time
# series. Therefore, set first value to zero or NA, remove last value and give date range of 
# other time series over newly created time series.
